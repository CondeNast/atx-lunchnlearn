Austin Lunch 'n' Learn
======================
Repo for tracking things we talk about at the Lunch 'n' Learn.

Every Wednesday at Noon (ATX-time) we gather in the big conference room for
lunch and a presentation.

Talk Topics
-----------
Talks are submitted via [issues][]. They can be presentation videos you've
seen online or something you want to present on. We'll decide day of what we
want to cover from the backlog.

### Interval vs External Talks
We want _all_ talks! Given that each team has a few folks here and most of
their team in NYC, it's a great idea to give quick talks on what y'all are
working on as part of your teams. Please feel free to pitch talk ideas
ranging from "who we are on team XYZ" to "check out this new feature / process
we're doing over on team XYZ."
