Austin Lunch n Learn
====================
Repo for tracking things we talk about at the Lunch 'n' Learn.

Every Wednesday at Noon (ATX-time) we gather in the big conference room for
lunch and a presentation.

Talk Topics
-----------
Talks are submitted via [issues][]. They can be presentation videos you've
seen online or something you want to present on. We'll decide day of what we
want to cover from the backlog.
